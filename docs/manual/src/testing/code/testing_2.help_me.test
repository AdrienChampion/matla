    3: Integration tests live in the optional `tests` directory of your project. A test is a *runnable* TLA
       module, *i.e.* a TLA file and its companion `.cfg` file.
       TLA integration test files must start with a test *configuration*, before the `----` module header.
       The configuration is written in toml and looks as follows, **inside** the code block.
       ```toml
       [test]
       only_in = <'none'|'debug'|'release'>
       expected = <result>
       ```
       where `only_in` is optional and `none` by default; `expected` is also
       optional and is `success` by default. Its value must be one of
       - `success`
       - `violation(assumption)`
       - `violation(deadlock)`
       - `violation(safety)`
       - `violation(liveness)`
       - `violation(assert)`
       - `failure(spec)`
       - `failure(safety)`
       - `failure(liveness)`
       - `error(spec_parse)`
       - `error(config_parse)`
       - `error(statespace_too_big)`
       - `error(system)`
